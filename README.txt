About This Release
==================

This is a bug-fix release, fixing a failure to correctly smooth the
onset detection function which caused the onset and beat tracking
plugins occasionally to miss onsets or find spurious ones.


Plugins Included
================

This plugin set includes the following plugins:

   * Note onset detector

   * Beat tracker and tempo estimator

   * Key estimator and tonal change detector

   * Adaptive multi-resolution FFT spectrogram

   * Polyphonic note transcription estimator

   * Segmenter, to divide a track into a consistent sequence of segments

   * Timbral and rhythmic similarity between audio tracks

   * Wavelet scalogram (discrete wavelet transform)

   * Chromagram, constant-Q spectrogram, and MFCC calculation plugins
