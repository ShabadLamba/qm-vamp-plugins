Compiling the QM Vamp Plugins
=============================

You will need:

 * Command-line compiler tools (for Windows this means MinGW)
 * The Vamp Plugin SDK (http://vamp-plugins.org/)


Compiling for Linux
-------------------

Run

$ make -f build/linux/Makefile.linux64

(or Makefile.linux32 for a 32-bit build)

If the Vamp Plugin SDK headers are not found, edit the Makefile to add
their location as a -I include flag in CXXFLAGS.


Compiling for OS/X
------------------

Make sure the Vamp Plugin SDK has been compiled in a directory
neighbouring this one (i.e. it lives in ../vamp-plugin-sdk). Run

$ make -f build/osx/Makefile.osx


Compiling for Windows
---------------------

Currently only MinGW builds are supported. The Makefile has only been
tested for cross-compiles (from Linux) but it will probably work
building natively too...

Make sure the Vamp Plugin SDK has been compiled in a directory
neighbouring this one (i.e. it lives in ../vamp-plugin-sdk). Run

$ gmake -f build/mingw32/Makefile.mingw32
